# MauiLottiePopupExample

## IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Do not use upper or camelcase in lottie filenames, use lower case only e.g. "testlottie.json".
- Ensure correct build action property for resource, e.g. on MAUI ASSET
- Ensure json file is in the raw folder.
- Ensure the lottie file is undamaged and working (i talk from expirience).
- Checkout the async inititalization to start the lottie with a slight delay of 50ms on the code behind the popupview.

Enjoy!
